 # BASIC USAGE
  
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt`
  
 # SEND NOTIFICATIONS TO SLACK
 Use `-s` switch to send notifications on your Slack wordspace. Add your slack webhook URL in **slack_variables.py** file.
  
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -s`
  
  # MATCHING STATUS CODES
  Use `-c` switch to filter HTTP Status Code from response. 
   
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -c 200,401,403`
  
  # OUTPUT RESULTS TO A FILE
  Write output to a file using `-o` switch.
  
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -o filename.txt`
  
  # FUZZ LIST OF URLS
  
  Fuzz a list of URLs, store output in file and activate slack notifications with following command.
  
  `./credax.sh urllist wordlist`
  
  # POST REQUESTS
  
  Use `-POST` to send POST Requests. By default Credax sends GET Requests for Fuzzing.
  
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -POST`
  
  # BYPASS 403
 
 CREDAX automatically tries to **bypass 403 Resopnse** using custom Headers. Just run credax against a domain name and let CREDAX do all the work for you.
 By default, Credax uses **127.0.0.1 IP Address** and **localhost** to bypass 403 response. 
 
 You can also set Custom IP Address to Bypass 403 Resposne using `-IP` Switch. 
 
 `python3 -d https://google.com/ -w wordlists.txt -IP 8.8.8.8`
 
 You can also use `-HOST` switch to pass string as an argument instead of an IP Address to bypass 403 Response. This string can be a `domain name` or any path such as `/admin` to bypass 403 Response.
 
 `python3 -d https://google.com/ -w wordlists.txt -HOST localhost`
 
 `python3 -d https://google.com/ -w wordlists.txt -HOST /admin`
